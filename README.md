      Python QR Code generator
   </h1>
</div>
This Python script is designed to make QR code which has a `url` in it. As of now, it has the ability to just take in URLs however feel free to add features like files or wifi credentials as an input.

## Usage

Make sure you have `python` & `git` installed on your system before using the tool.

- Clone the script: `git clone https://github.com/mansoorbarri/qr-code`
- Change directory: `cd qr-code`
- install the requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 
- Run the validator: `python3 qr.py` 

*you might have to run the validator with `python` instead of `python3` especially in Windows.*

## Support
- Leaving a ⭐️ would mean a lot!
